# Push the whole repository through the GitHub Contents API
#
# Why this script is needed:
#   git push from this machine does not work -- a TCP connection to github.com:443 can be established,
#   but the server resets it after the TLS handshake (`curl 52 Empty reply from server`),
#   and going through the local proxy (127.0.0.1:7897) behaves the same.
#   api.github.com does work, so we switched to uploading files one by one through the Contents API.
#
# Usage:
#   py -3.12 tools/push_via_api.py                   Push all changes
#   py -3.12 tools/push_via_api.py --dry-run         Only show what would be pushed
#   py -3.12 tools/push_via_api.py --message "..."   Specify the commit message
#
# Token lookup order:
#   1. The GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
#   2. The github.com line in ~/.git-credentials
# The token is never printed.
